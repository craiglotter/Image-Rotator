Image Rotator

Image Rotator is designed to quickly apply rotation and flip transformations to all the image files contained in a user-specified folder. 

The image rotation direction, degree and flip axis can all be adjusted and the resulting images are saved as .jpg files, all suffixed with '_gtransform.jpg'.

Note that the procedure is non-recursive.
